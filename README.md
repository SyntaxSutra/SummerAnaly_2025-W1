Week-1 Assignment – Data Analysis with Cars Dataset
# 🚗 Summer Analytics 2025 – Week 1 Assignment

Welcome to my submission for **Week 1** of the Summer Analytics 2025 program!  
This project explores the **Cars dataset** through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

---

## 📂 Notebook

- `SA2025_W1_Solution.ipynb`: Contains the full analysis – from loading the data to drawing final insights.

---

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- `pandas` for data handling
- `numpy` for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations

---

## 📊 Key Tasks

- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values in `horsepower`)
- Explored relationships between `mpg`, `weight`, `displacement`, and `model_year`
- Created visualizations: histograms, scatter plots, trend lines
- Analyzed car origins and their impact on fuel efficiency

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Fuel efficiency improved significantly over the years (1970–1982)
- Heavier and more powerful cars tend to have lower MPG
- Japanese cars lead in average fuel efficiency
- Correlation analysis revealed strong links between engine size, weight, and fuel consumption
